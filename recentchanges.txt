Removed the hand group as a dedicated pile type. Any pile can now be expanded in-game.  An expanded pile behaves the same as the original hand group did.
Added ViewState property to group to define which type of pile it is ("Expanded", "Pile", "Collapsed").
Python API can get or set the ViewState.
Multiple piles can be expanded at once.
Game serializer will convert existing hand groups into the new format (for backwards compatibility)
Slight re-organization of the OCTGN Options window.
